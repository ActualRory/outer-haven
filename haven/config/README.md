# Haven Config Folder

In this folder are modified copies of the files in the /config folder. The files found there should not be modified. Instead, please make config changes in here.

Before the game is compiled to run on a host, the server admin must manually copy over this folder (/haven/config) into the root of the repository, overwriting the original files (/config). Compiling outerhaven.dme after this task will cause the build to use the Haven configurations.
